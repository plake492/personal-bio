        <p>My name is Patrick Clancy Lake. I've lived in Orlando FL my entire life, although I hope to change that in the next few years. I love cool weather and mountains (you can probably see why I don't want to live here too much longer). I'm married to my wife Victoria and we have a little girl named Selah. I've been a musician for over a decade, playing the electric and acoustic guitar. My hope upon completion of this course is to quickly find work using my new found skills, enabling me to continue to learn and grow in an interesting industry</p>
